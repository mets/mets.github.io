# Changes from METS 1 to METS 2

Compared to METS 1, METS 2 simplifies the schema, makes it more consistent, and
removes reliance on the outdated XLink standard. It aims to retain a clear path
for migration from METS 1 for most use cases.

There is also a [detailed description the changes from METS 1 to METS
2](METS2_whitepaper.html) along with
fully-worked examples of METS 2 documents.
